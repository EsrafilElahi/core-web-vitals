## Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) : 
* change size of section suddenly, for example cards section (images hasn't width-height size) suddenly shown on the screen and screen-layout, screen-grid become disordered
* It appears suddenly and screen layout and griding disordered
* one of usecase is use width-height size on image elements --> to don't be disorderly as soon as page loaded
* for images - use width and height size (in nextjs use <Image width={400} height={400} />)
* good : .1s or less
